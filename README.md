## Professional Self-Assessment
### Computer Science Degree
[File](https://github.com/tawil4/tawil4.github.io/blob/main/Professional%20Self-Assessment%C2%A0-%20Adam%20Tawil.docx)

This is a professional self-assessment written to reflect on my capstone and experience in the computer science program. This serves as a formal introduction to the portfolio. I mentioned what I have learned, various skills obtained, artifacts I worked on throughout school, and the artifacts I have enhanced during the capstone course.  


## Code Review
### Full Stack Development and Computational Graphics and Visualization
[Video](https://github.com/tawil4/tawil4.github.io/blob/main/Code%20Review%20-%20Adam%20Tawil.mp4)

This code review is a walkthrough of the original code and planned enhancements. I provide a clear and complete description of the existing code while also analyzing using code review criteria to clearly state findings. I highlighted weaknesses and target areas for improvement such as coding best practices and documentation needed. I also explain planned enhancements for the artifact.  


## Enhanced Artifacts
### Travlr Web Application (Software Design and Engineering)

This artifact contains the Travlr Getaways web application where I make software design and engineering enhancements. The enhancements I made were fulfilling the clients' original needs that included a reservations tab, better designed UI/UX, sign-up functionality, and client-side validation.  


### OpenGL Scene (Algorithms and Data Structures)

[Image](https://github.com/tawil4/tawil4.github.io/blob/main/opengl_scene.png)

This artifact contains the OpenGL scene that was created to resemble a real-life scene using complex objects, textures, and lighting. I enhanced the artifact by changing shapes, textures, materials, colors, and lighting to better resemble the real-life scene compared to my first edition in the course.   


### Travlr Web Application (Databases)
